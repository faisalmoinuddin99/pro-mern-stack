1. The render() method is something that that the React framework calls when it
needs to display the component.

2. But render() is one that must be present; otherwise you’ll have a component that has no
screen presence.

3. Within the render() method, we’re supposed to return a native component instance,
or an instance of a component defined by us. In this case, we returned a <div> element,
just like the first Hello World example used an <h1> element.

4. Let’s take a closer look at the last line:
...
ReactDOM.render(<IssueList />, contentNode);
...

5. Here, we rendered an instantiation of the IssueList component into the contents
element defined in index.html. To instantiate a component, you write it in JSX as if it
were an element, enclosed within angle brackets. It’s worth noting here that div and
h1 are built-in internal React components that you can directly instantiate, whereas
IssueList is something that you define and later instantiate. And within IssueList, you
use React’s built-in div component.
I’ve used component and instance of a component interchangeably, like sometimes
we tend to do with objects. But it should be obvious by now that IssueList and div are
actually React component classes, whereas <IssueList /> and <div /> are tangible
components or instances of the component class.
