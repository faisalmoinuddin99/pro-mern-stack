****************** EXERCISE: NPM ****************

1. Find out what difference --save made. Try uninstalling and
re-installing express with and without this option. Hint: The
difference is in package.json ?

ANS: The npm option --save causes the installation/uninstallation
to be recorded under the dependencies section of
package.json.

2. When was package.json created? If you can't guess, inspect
the contents for a hint. Still can't figure out? Go back and redo
your steps. Start with creation of the project directory, and look
at the directory contents at each step.

ANS: package.json got created when we created the project using
npm init. In fact, all of the responses to the prompts when we
ran npm init were recorded in package.json.


************* EXERCISE: EXPRESS *******************

1. Change the name of the file index.html to something else, say,
hello.html . How does this affect the application?

ANS: The static file middleware does not specially treat hello.html
as it did index.html, so you will have to access the application
with the name of the file like this: http://localhost:3000/
hello.html.


2. If you wanted all static files to be accessed by a prefixed URL, for
example /public , what change would you make? Hint: Take a
look at the Express documentation for static files and try this out.

ANS: For accessing static files via a different mount point, specify that
prefix in the middleware generated helper function as the first
parameter. The directory name will now be the second parameter.
For example, express.static('/public', 'static').

3. Change the name of the web application file from server.js to
something else, say, app.js . Now, what options do you have for
starting up the web server? Hint: Look up the npm documentation,
in specific, CLI commands and the command run-script .

ANS: By default, npm start runs the command node server.js.
If you use some other file name, say app.js, you should add
"start": "node app.js" as a script under the scripts
section of package.json to tell npm that this is the actual start
command. Alternatively, you could just run the server yourself
without using npm, using the command node app.js.


**************** EXERCISE: ES2015 ***************

1. Try to format the message as one per line by using <br /> to
join the individual messages instead of a space. Are you able to
do it? Why not?

ANS: React does this on purpose, to avoid cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities. It is not easy to insert HTML markup, although
there is a way using the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute
of an element. The correct way to do this is to compose an
array of components. We will explore this in later chapters.

2. Inspect the generated App.js now. What is new because of
ES2015 transformation?

ANS: Without ES2015 transformation, only JSX snippets were
transformed. Now, with ES2015 transformation, even
JavaScript is modified.
